,sciName,"unique combination of taxonomic genus and specific epithet with an underscore connecting them to be used in the MDD.  Uses formula, DO NOT EDIT MANUALLY"
,id,"unique identification number used for indexing and permalinking; initially numbered (14 Sep 2020) as counting up from 1000001 when sorting by phylosort, suborder, infraorder... genus, speciesEpithet; subsequent numbering will be added from 1006485 and up"
,phylosort,"sort the 27 extant orders of mammals according to their phylogenetic hierarchy, following Figure 1 in the Introduction of Checklist of the Mammals of the World (2020)"
,mainCommonName,"common name in the form used in the Handbook of the Mammals of the world series; all words capitalized unless it is the second word in a hyphenated word; directions and any 'and' statements in names are hyphenated (e.g., Black-and-white Ruffed Lemur, South-western Myotis); consistency is attempted throughout a genus in terms of unique name and names based on the genus are typically avoided, although not exclusively (e.g., all Crocidura with the name 'White-toothed Shrew'; the use of White-bellied Rat instead of Niviventer as the common name for the genus); the name is the most broadly encompasing named to avoid confusion when possible (e.g., the use of Wapiti for Cervus canadensis rather than 'Elk', which is also used for Alces alces in Europe)"
,otherCommonNames,other common names that have been used for the species as identified in literature; all names are separated by pipes (|) and follow the same format listed under 'mainCommonName'

Pavan, Mendes-Oliveira, & Voss); if the volume was described in a book or journal article with a differing set of editors/authors in the author line, an 'in' is used after the initial authors, followed by the editors/authors of the primary text (e.g., Ambrose in Butynski, Kingdon, & Kalina); when two authors share the same surname, the initials are added before the surname in both cases, and if they share the same initials, than the middle name is also written out (e.g. J. A. Allen and G. M. Allen); for names of Chinese, Korean, and Indochinese origin, the full name is writen out with the suriname put first and hyphens removed to match the format typically given in Chinese publication (e.g., Kuo Haochih, Fang Yinping, Csorba, & Lee Lingling); the suffix 'Jr.' is not included in any name unless it is fully spelt out and part of the surname"

Pavan, Mendes-Oliveira, & Voss); if the volume was described in a book or journal article with a differing set of editors/authors in the author line, an 'in' is used after the initial authors, followed by the editors/authors of the primary text (e.g., Ambrose in Butynski, Kingdon, & Kalina); when two authors share the same surname, the initials are added before the surname in both cases, and if they share the same initials, than the middle name is also written out (e.g. J. A. Allen and G. M. Allen); for names of Chinese, Korean, and Indochinese origin, the full name is writen out with the suriname put first and hyphens removed to match the format typically given in Chinese publication (e.g., Kuo Haochih, Fang Yinping, Csorba, & Lee Lingling); the suffix 'Jr.' is not included in any name unless it is fully spelt out and part of the surname"
